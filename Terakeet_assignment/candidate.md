# Submission Notes

This info will be read by the dev team. Let us know what you thought!

## Given more time, what would you have done differently?
*answer*
If I had more time, I would have started working on getting the data from the API sooner.
I started off by hard coding data to get the game working. I also would have set up the cards to be a component.

## What part of your submission are you most proud of?
*answer*
Im most proud of the game being functional and asthetically pleasing. Also that I was able to incorperate a reset button to start the game over. 

## Is there anything else you'd like us to know?
*answer*
As you can see in the code, I got close to having the data pull from the API. The issue I ran into is passing the data from mounted() up to data
on the Vue instance.
